The Twinkle Hat is a simple hat that is worked in the round and uses a combination of knit and slip stitches to create a beautiful texture.

The stitch used to create the squishy texture is called 'Eye of Partridge' and is often used to enforce the heel of a sock.

## Materials

- Size 5mm and 4mm knitting needles (circular or double pointed)
- 250yds / 230m sport weight yarn (recommended: "Freia Ombr√© M/S Sport (Refined) Gradient", shown in "Aloha")
- Tapestry needle
- Scissors
- Measuring tape

## Gauge

22 sts / 4''

## Sizes

Adult

## Finished hat measurements

Unstretched: circumference: 22''

## Notes

- The hat is worked in the round. I prefer to use circular needles (usually with the magic loop technique), but the pattern also works for double pointed needles.
- If you'd like to adjust the number of stitches for the cast-on, make sure it's a multiple of two.
- The ribbed brim is about 1.5'' tall, add or subtract rounds depending on how high you would like it to be
- I find it helpful to use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of a round

## Pattern

### Cast on

Using 4mm needles:

CO 120 sts and join to work in the round.

### Brim

**Row 1 - 12:** \*K1, P1\* around

### Main

Switch to 5mm needles.

**Row 1:** \*K\* around

**Row 2:** \*K1, Sl1\* around

**Row 3:** \*K\* around

**Row 4:** \*Sl1, K1\* around

**Row 5 - 64:** Repeat the above 4 rounds (or until hat - incl. brim - measures approx. 6'' / 15cm)

### Crown

Summary: Decrease 8sts every 2nd row

======= Alternative

**Setup:** \*K27, Sl2-K1-P2sso, place marker\* around (112sts)

**Row 1:** \*K1, Sl1\* around

**Row 2:** \*K until 3 sts before marker, Sl2-K1-P2sso\* around

**Row 3:** \*Sl1, K1\* around

**Row 4:** \*K until 3 sts before marker, Sl2-K1-P2sso\* around

Repeat Rows 1 - 4 until there are 16 sts left

Cut yarn and using the darning needle, thread tail through remaining stitches.
Pull tight, make a knot and weave in ends.
