The Twinkle Hat is a simple hat that is worked in the round and uses a combination of knit and slip stitches to create a beautiful texture.

## Materials

- Size 5mm and 4mm knitting needles (circular or double pointed)
- 250yds / 230m sport weight yarn (recommended: "Freia Ombr√© M/S Sport (Refined) - Gradient", shown in "Aloha")
- Tapestry needle
- Scissors
- Measuring tape

## Finished hat measurements

## Notes

- The hat is worked in the round. I prefer to use circular needles (usually with the magic loop technique), but the pattern also works for double pointed needles.
- If you'd like to adjust the number of stitches for the cast-on, make sure it's a multiple of two.
- The ribbed brim is about 1.5'' tall, add or subtract rounds depending on how high you would like it to be
- I find it helpful to use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of a round
