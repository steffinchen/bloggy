The Twinkle Hat is a simple hat that is worked in the round and uses a combination of knit and slip stitches to create a beautiful texture.

The stitch used to create the squishy texture is called 'Eye of Partridge' and is often used to enforce the heel of a sock. I love the subtle texture it creates and wanted to show off the stitch in a different place than the heel of a sock, which, let's be honest, not many will see.

## Materials

- Size 5mm and 4mm knitting needles (circular or double pointed)
- 175yds / 160m sport weight yarn
- Stitch markers
- Tapestry needle
- Scissors
- Measuring tape

![The yarn I used: "Freia Ombré" in "Aloha"](img/twinkle-hat/freia_yarn.png)

## Gauge

25 sts / 4''

## Sizes

Adult (fits head circumferences between 20 - 24'')

## Finished hat measurements

Unstretched: circumference: 19''

## Notes

- Sample is shown in ["Freia Ombré M/S Sport (Refined) Gradient", color "Aloha"](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/knitwhits-freia-handpaints-freia-ombre-m-s-sport-refined---gradient). I used roughly 2/3 of a skein for the hat, so the other 1/3 is great to make a pompom!
- The hat is worked in the round. I prefer to use circular needles (usually with the magic loop technique), but the pattern also works for double pointed needles.
- The ribbed brim is about 1.5'' tall, add or subtract rounds depending on how high you would like it to be
- I find it helpful to use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of a round
- The pattern uses a stitch to decrease two stitches at once. This helps to preserve the Eye of Partridge pattern. I chose the "Sl2-K1-P2sso" to do so, but feel free to use another double decrease. [TinCanKnits has a great how-to explaining the Sl2-K1-P2sso](https://blog.tincanknits.com/2016/01/21/central-double-decrease/)
- If you'd like to adjust the number of stitches for the cast-on, make sure it's a multiple of two. For the decrease, place the four decrease points (Sl2-K1-P2sso) equidistant in the row - the exact placement doesn't matter

## Pattern

### Cast on

Using 4mm needles:

CO 120 sts and join to work in the round.

### Brim

**Rows 1 - 12:** \*K1, P1\* around

### Main

Switch to 5mm needles.

**Row 1:** \*K\* around

**Row 2:** \*K1, Sl1\* around

**Row 3:** \*K\* around

**Row 4:** \*Sl1, K1\* around

**Rows 5 - 64:** Repeat the above 4 row (or until hat - incl. brim - measures approx. 6'' / 15cm)

### Crown

Summary: Decrease 8sts every 2nd row

**Setup:** \*K27, Sl2-K1-P2sso, place marker\* around (112sts)

**Row 1:** \*K1, Sl1\* around

**Row 2:** \*K until 3 sts before marker, Sl2-K1-P2sso\* around (decreased 8sts)

**Row 3:** \*Sl1, K1\* around

**Row 4:** \*K until 3 sts before marker, Sl2-K1-P2sso\* around (decreased 8sts)

Repeat Rows 1 - 4 until there are 16 sts left

Cut yarn and using the darning needle, thread tail through remaining stitches.
Pull tight, make a knot and weave in ends.
